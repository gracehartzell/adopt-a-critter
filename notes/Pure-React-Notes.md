# Pure React Notes

More verbose but very easy to maintain

## Project
* Pet adoption app 
* Started with just the `src` folder and `index.html`
* `unpkg`: CDN for moduels that are on npm so you can load in npm packages to experiment with
* React in 2 packages: React-Native (thanks, Facebook) uses same API but changed **rendering**
**layer**. Need ReactDOM so it will render to the DOM

Upon initial launch: expect "not rendered"
