## Site Photos

#### Homepage

- When you first visit the site, there will be a default location of Evanston, IL. The site will automatically load with all animals that are available in that location.

#### Search Page

- You're able to use the search box to choose a location, animal type, and/or breed. In order to select a breed, you must have already selected an animal type.

Similarly, you can click on the magnifying lens in the upper right corner to go to the search parameters page. This page contains the same search box, but won't display any results until you've selected "submit", at which point you'll be redirected back to the original page with the updated search results.
